<h2> Julio Luna </h2>
<p>My name is Juan Emilio M. Luna. My family moved to australia when I was pretty young(around 3 yrs. old or something), exposing me to the 
english language. My parents told me stories that I spoke fluent english when I was a kid, and that I was not the crying or tantrum type.

<p> During highschool, I never really fancied myself with academics. I wasn't even sure of what course I would take up in college.
All I wanted to do was to play Pokemon and ride my skateboard.

I am currently a student here in UPLB, studying under the BACA program. I still play pokemon and ride my skateboard all day.

I imagine myself being with this pretty lady in the future. I would still be playing pokemon and riding my skateboard everyday.
