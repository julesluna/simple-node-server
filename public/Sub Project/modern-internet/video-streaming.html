	<p>On 5 September 1995, ESPN SportsZone streamed a live radio broadcast of a baseball game between the Seattle Mariners and the New York Yankees to thousands of its subscribers worldwide using cutting-edge technology developed by a Seattle-based startup company named Progressive Networks. It was the world's first livestreaming event. A few years later the company would change its name to RealNetworks and before long it would find itself embroiled in a bitter technological and legal war with Microsoft for domination of a brand new technology market – streaming media.Though the prospect of streaming media over the internet had always excited technology nerds and CEOs alike, streaming media's childhood years were primarily marred by pragmatic problems such as how to successfully stream watchable video over 56k modem lines. Microsoft emerged from the war with RealNetworks as a winner (thanks to its Windows Media technologies), but soon found itself unable to capitalise on the victory. While the Redmond-based US company frittered away its advantage, Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems) slowly but surely eroded Windows Media's market share in the mid-2000s in favour of its increasingly popular Flash Player. Flash shook up the streaming media industry by seamlessly marrying interactivity, Web 2.0 and streaming media for the first time. A new era in streaming media had arrived, but the old problems still remained – bandwidth, scalability and reach.</p>
	<p>Consumers who watch streaming video online represent an important technology trend for 2010. The rise in popularity of streaming video is good news for business owners who use Internet marketing to reach their target audiences. Business owners should read this article to understand why streaming video is good for business, including how big businesses have recognized the value of video for Internet marketing and how video is increasingly important for consumer education and entertainment.</p>
