<h2> Julio's List Of Favorite Things </h2>
<h3> My Top 3 Movie Picks </h3>
<ul>
<li>First on my list of favorite movies would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0uJRJtuVZQ"> Pokemon: The First Movie </a> for the sole reason that it is the first Pokemon movie released and that I've watched which reminds me of my childhood.</li>  
<li>Second on my list would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEm3pSP46gc"> Pokemon: Jirachi Wish Maker </a>. I even bought an original DVD of this movie, which shows how much love I have for this movie.</li>
<li>Lastly, a rather recent film is part of the list. That would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i51OdaPCe4"> Pokemon: Diance And The Cocoon Of Destruction </a>. Pokemon movies have never failed to be part of my list of favorite movies, and the latest release from the Pokemon Company blew me away.</li>
</ul>

<h3> My Top 3 Songs </h3>
<ul>
<li>First on my list of favorite songs would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKVYCGuq0ok"> Bury Your Head </a> by my one my favorite bands, Saosin. Every element of this song makes me feel that life is good. LOL.</li> 
<li>Second on the list would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVPooKsLxII"> Desperate Times, Desperate Measures </a> by Underoath, again being one of my favorite bands. Considered a "noisy" band, they have inspirational lyrics mostly attributed to the christian faith, which is particularly heard on this song.</li>
<li>Lastly, the song from my most favorite band in the whole world, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lGxPLP91aM"> An Invitation </a> by Urbandub. I no longer have to explain why this is my favorite song. Just click on the link and listen to it. Urbandub is life!</li>
