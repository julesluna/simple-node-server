The ability to transmit messages within the military and the allies in 

complete secrecy is one of the most important aspects ofcommunications during 

warfare. Today, with all of the technological advancement that make high-

technology digital encryption systems available, ensuring security and 

privacy when transmitting codes of message is fairly easy. However, during 

the World War II, the need for confidentiality in message transmission led 

those involved to develop their own various forms of encrypted communication. 

These methods ranged from sending trained carrier pigeons to developing new 

electronic encryption systems. Various countries involved in World War II all 

fought the same battle for secrecy, so when the Germans developed their own 

system called the Enigma, they thought they had  the  advantage among the 

rest.

Enigma was very much like a typewriter except for its ability to encode 

highly encrypted text messages. It was originally intended for commercial 

purposes, but then the German military saw its potential.

The German military seemed like an impenetrable fortress because of their 

remarkable encryption system, but after the Allies in Poland obtained an 

Enigma machine, they were joined by British and French forces in high hopes 

of decrypting the German codes. The effort of setting up a school in 

Buckinghamshire's Bletchley Park and bringing in mathematicians, logicians, 

and experts in problem solving bore fruit when these experts created 

prototypes of electronic machines to decrypt codes on a much larger scale.

By this time, the German army was still confident with the secrecy they enjoy 

using the Enigma, so much so that they adopted the Enigma ciphers within all 

of their army, navy, air force, and secret services. Earlier attempts in 

cracking the Enigma codes only revealed bits of information, but in 1941 new 

information was discovered that revealed Germany's plans to invade Greece. 

Not long after, other intel was decrypted and revealed information on the 

Italian navy, which resulted to the Allies' victory during the Battle of Cape 

Matapan.
