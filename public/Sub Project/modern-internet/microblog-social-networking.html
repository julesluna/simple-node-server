	<p> Source from:</p>
	<p>A Brief History of Blogging. (n.d.). Retrieved July 26, 2015.</p>
	<p>The first social networks were created over 100,000 years ago. Historical evidence suggests that certain elements of social network structures may have been present at an early point in human history. Early humans may have formed ties with both kin and non-kin, based on sharing common interests and their tendency to co-operate to reach a goal. Eg they formed networks to kill mammoths, and I’d bet they had social networks that partied on afterwards.</p>
	<p>The first of the online social networks was Geocities in 1994, then Theglobe.com and Sixdegrees.com. Then in early 2002 (after we all survived the Y2K meltdown) sites like Friendster, Myspace and LinkedIn were started and growing fast. In 2004, Facebook was launched, originally as a college social site, but soon spread to public use. In 2006 Twitter was launched as a micro blogging platform similar to mobile texting. In 2011 Google created their own social networking site called Google+.</p>		
	<p>Today there are 1000s of social networking sites being used by 28% of the planet’s population (in Australia it is 50% of the population). The top 5 social networking sites are Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Google+ which claim the market share.</p>
